## About Me

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Caterina!  

Iâ€™ve always been curious by nature and love diving into new challenges.  
My journey started in literature ðŸ“š, but along the way I discovered a real passion for tech, problem-solving, and building things.  

That led me to web development ðŸ’», and now Iâ€™m leveling up again through a Data Engineering bootcamp ðŸš€.
