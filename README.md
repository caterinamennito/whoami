## About Me

Hi there 👋 I'm Caterina!  

I’ve always been curious by nature and love diving into new challenges.  
My journey started in literature 📚, but along the way I discovered a real passion for tech, problem-solving, and building things.  

That led me to web development 💻, and now I’m leveling up again through a Data Engineering bootcamp 🚀.
